#            between them.  For example, if you are testing permissions, 
#            compare should fail if the files have different permissions.

# Note: You should NOT assume that this file was produced by your create
#   function.  This should be a general test.  You should be able to handle
#   files that don't posess the property of interest at all without failing.
#   You should also do your best to only test a single property (or group
#   of properties) so that the meaning of a failure is clear.
